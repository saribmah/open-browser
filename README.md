> AI-powered sandbox for any website - just add `open-` to any supported URL

## What is open-browser?

open-browser transforms how you interact with websites by adding AI capabilities to any supported platform. Simply prefix any supported URL with `open-` to boot up an AI-powered sandbox where you can chat, analyze, and interact with the content in new ways.

## Supported Sites

Currently supporting:

- **GitHub** - `open-github.com` - Analyze repositories, understand code, explore issues and PRs with AI assistance
- **arXiv** - `open-arxiv.org` - Dive deep into research papers with AI-powered explanations and insights

## How It Works

1. Take any supported URL (e.g., `github.com/user/repo`)
2. Add `open-` prefix (e.g., `open-github.com/user/repo`)
3. Get instant access to an AI-powered sandbox with chat capabilities
4. Ask questions, analyze content, and interact with the site in new ways

## Examples

```
github.com/torvalds/linux → open-github.com/torvalds/linux
arxiv.org/abs/2103.00000 → open-arxiv.org/abs/2103.00000
```
